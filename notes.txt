/	Replace 'timestamp_in_ms' with the current timestamp in millisecondsand 'X' with the philosopher number.	/

MANDATORY PART

>>	Each philosopher should be a thread
>>	Forks
	>>>	There is one fork between each pair of philosophers.
	>>>	Therefore, if there are several philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their rightside.
	>>>	If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table.
	>>>	To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them.
